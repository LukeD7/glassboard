# Contributing to Glassboard

Thanks for your interest.

Glassboard is intentionally small and opinionated.
Not all contributions or feature requests will be accepted.

---

## Guiding Principle

Glassboard is not trying to be the most powerful clipboard manager.

It is trying to be the **most obvious** one.

Changes that add complexity, configuration, or cognitive load are unlikely
to be accepted.

---

## What Is Welcome

- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Accessibility improvements
- UI polish that preserves simplicity
- Code cleanup and refactors
- Documentation improvements

---

## What Is Not Welcome (Without Prior Discussion)

- Cloud sync of any kind
- Preference panels
- Snippets or templates
- Tags, folders, or metadata systems
- Multiple clipboard modes
- Reworking core UX decisions

If you are unsure, open an issue before writing code.

## Locked Design Decisions

The following are intentional and not up for debate:

- List view (not grid)
- Screenshot-first layout
- Implicit search (typing filters results)
- Minimal pinning
- Keyboard-first interaction

PRs that violate these may be closed without merging.

---

## Code Guidelines

- Swift + AppKit
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Keep dependencies minimal

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a focused branch
3. Keep changes small and scoped
4. Explain **why** the change is needed

UI changes should include screenshots or short screen recordings.

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful.
Assume good intent.
Disagreement is fine; hostility is not.
