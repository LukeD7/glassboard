# Glassboard

A fast, visual clipboard history for macOS.

Glassboard brings the immediacy of Windows **Win + V** to macOS, with first-class
support for screenshots, instant search, and keyboard-driven use.

No accounts. No cloud. No configuration.

---

## Why

macOS has a powerful clipboard system but no usable history UI.

Glassboard exists because:
- Clipboard history should be **visible**
- Screenshots should be **first-class**
- Pasting should require **zero thought**

This is not a power tool.
It is a simple, opinionated replacement for invisible clipboard behavior.

## Non-Goals

Glassboard deliberately does **not** include:

- Cloud or iCloud sync
- Accounts or analytics
- Snippets or templates
- Clipboard editing
- Tags, folders, or collections
- Preferences UI
- Raycast or Alfred integrations

If a feature needs explanation, it probably doesn’t belong here.

## Philosophy

1. Recognition beats recall  
2. Visual beats textual  
3. Speed beats flexibility  

Opinionated design is intentional.
